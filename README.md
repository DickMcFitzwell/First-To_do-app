A simple to do app written in Python. This is my first app, and I intend on improving and upgrading it as I learn. I would like
to get it to a point where I can use it across multiple devices and shared between multiple authenticated users. This will be my 
testbed for learning how to code, how to use github, and how to design a user friendly app. On the off chance that someone actually
find this thing, please reach out to me with suggestions on how I can improve it. I'm always looking to learn.
